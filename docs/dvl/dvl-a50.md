## Description
The DVL-A50 is – by far – the world’s smallest commercially available Doppler Velocity Log.

The A50 is establishing a new market standard with its high performance, ultra-small 4 beam setup, open interface protocol and low cost.

The DVL estimates velocity relative to the sea bottom by sending acoustic waves from the four angled transducers and then measure the frequency shift (doppler effect) from the received echo. By combining the measurements of all four transducers and the time between each acoustic pulse, it is possible to very accurately estimate the speed and direction of movement.

!!! Note
	The DVL-A50 uses a constant speed of sound equal to 1500 m/s (Release 1.3.1). This is configurable for the Performance edition.

!!! Tip
	Keep the DVL-A50 in a bucket of water to ensure sufficient cooling when using the DVL on a workbench.
