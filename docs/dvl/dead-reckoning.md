## Position

Based on measures from .... the DVL calculates a relative position ...

Speed and distance is ... and downward...

The position can be viewed in a [map](../gui/dashboard/) or be read from the [API](../dvl-protocol/#local-position)

## Speed and distances
In addition to the calculated position, you can read current speed and distance in each direction of the x, y and x coordinates...

## Gyro

The measured rotations from the built in gyro are referred to as pitch, roll and yaw. These corresponds to the rotation around the x, y and z-axis.
