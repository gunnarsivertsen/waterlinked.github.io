# Introduction

The Underwater GPS is a robust and reliable acoustic positioning system with a range of 100m. The purpose of the system is to give a live GPS position of ROVs, surface-supplied divers and other moving objects below
the water surface.

The Underwater GPS system is based on Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. The Locator is placed on a ROV or diver and functions as a beacon that sends out an acoustic pulse. Near the surface, there are four receiver hydrophones lowered into the water. The receivers listen for the pulse from the locator. Time-of-arrival to each receiver is used to calculate the Locatorâ€™s position. SBL systems, compared to the USBL systems, have the advantage of working well in shallow water and noisy acoustic environments, such as in a fish cage.

Once the position is known relative to the receivers, the global position can be found by adding that to the position obtained by a GPS receiver. The Underwater GPS system does that part internally so that it can provide the actual global position of the ROV as it's output.
