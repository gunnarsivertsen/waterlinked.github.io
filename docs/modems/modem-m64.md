# Modem-M64

## Description

The Modem M64 is a two-way half-duplex 64bps acoustic modem with a robust and user configurable data link.

The M64 sets a new market standard with its record-breaking physical size, low power requirement and cost. All this combined with a very useful technical specification, the M64 opens new possibilities for underwater communication in both existing and new areas.

## Key specifications

* Two-way communication

* 64 bit per second net data link, both ways

* Latency 1.5 â€“ 2.5 sec

* 200 meter range

## LED Signals

* No green light: Power is off.

* Flashing green light (every 3 seconds): Modem is trying to pair with another modem.

* Fixed green light: Modem has sync with another modem. The LED will blink each time it receives a packet from the other modem (once a second).
