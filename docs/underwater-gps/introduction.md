The Underwater GPS G2 is a new and improved version of the Explorer Kit. It provides an even more robust and reliable acoustic positioning system with a range of up to 300m (R300 edition). The purpose of the system is to give a live GPS position of ROVs, divers and other moving objects below the water surface.

The Underwater GPS system is based on Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. A Locator is attached to the device to be positioned and functions as a beacon that send out an acoustic pulse. Near the surface, four Receiver hydrophones are lowered into the water to receive the beacon signal. The Receivers listen for the pulse from the Locator. Time-of-arrival to each Receiver is used to calculate the Locatorâ€™s position. SBL systems, compared to USBL systems, have the advantage of working well in shallow water and acoustic reflective environments such as in fish cages, near harbor installations, close to ship hulls, inside water tanks etc.

Once the position is known relative to the Receivers, the global position can be found by adding that to the position obtained by a GPS receiver. The Underwater GPS system does that part internally so that it can provide the actual global position of the ROV as it's output.

## Warnings

To avoid any damage to the Underwater GPS, please read these warnings carefully before it is installed and used for the first time.

|                     |                     |
| ------------------- |:------------------- |
| **Operation medium** | The Underwater GPS system will ONLY work with both a Locator and the Receivers in water. It will not work in air. |
| **Max voltage** | The absolute maximum voltage rating of the equipment is 30V. Voltages above this will damage the electronics. |
| **Temperature** | Make sure the system does not overheat. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight over extended periods of time. |
| **Salt water** | The contents of the Topside housing will corrode and/or short if in contact with salt water. Keep the housing lid closed when in the field to avoid salt water getting inside. |
| **Force** | Avoid using excessive force on connectors, screws and other parts of the system as this can lead to mechanical failure. |
