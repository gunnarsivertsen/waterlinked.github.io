## Description

The Locator-A1 has the smallest physical footprint in our series of locators. It can be integrated into even the most compact ROVs. The Locator-A1 does not carry its own depth sensor, so the UGPS G2 system requires that the depth be provided from your underwater vehicle (ROV, etc.) This can achieved by means of the [UGPS API](../integration/api.md).

## Wiring interface

The tables below shows the pinning of the A1 interface connectors.
