# Modem-M16

The Modem M16 is a two-way, half-duplex acoustic modem operating at 10bps that can function dependably in the presence of other modems configured on distinct channels. Boasting an impressively compact size, minimal power consumption, and affordable cost, the Modem M16 is a groundbreaking addition to the field. This innovation paves the way for successful underwater communication in complex environments, particularly where power resources for sensors are scarce.
