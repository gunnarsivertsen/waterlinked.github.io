# Locator-D1

## Description

The Locator-D1 carries its own depth sensor and can therefore operate fully stand-alone and independent of the device you want to position.

!!! warning
    The Locator-D1 can only be submerged for about 6 hours. It then needs to dry the pressure sensor in order to give correct depth readings.
